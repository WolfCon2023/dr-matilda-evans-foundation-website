Much credit must be given to the practical success of Miss Schofield’s school work for the marvelous strides made by the education of the Negro at such celebrated institutions as Hampton in Virginia, with an enrollment annually of over 1500 students and in endowment of over $1 million. And at Tuskegee, with about an equal number of students and as a great or greater endowment fund.

Then there are other great institutions devoted entirely to the education of the colored race making quite a feature of the Industrial Department, such as Atlanta University in Atlanta, GA. Fisk University in Nashville TN, Hanes Institute in Augusta GA. And Spellman University, Atlanta, GA., Claflin and the Agricultural. Colored State College at Orangeburg, SC.

Also, Benedict College at Columbia and Voorhees Institute at Denmark (SC) all of which have grown into existence and attained a topmost rung of the ladder of fame since the coming to the South of Martha Schofield in 1865.
