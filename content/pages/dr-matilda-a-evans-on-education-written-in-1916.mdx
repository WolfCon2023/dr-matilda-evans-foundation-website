One of the benefits conferred by education is enlightening the mind on the subject of one’s duty. Finding what is duty, the manner of discharging it will suggest itself to the alert, the active, and those of industrious and intelligent discernment. Perhaps forever hidden would remain the necessity for certain tasks were it not for the inspiration idealists receive from education. This education, if proper and well rounded, also forces all who embrace it into the line of work promising the accomplishment of the greatest achievements – achievements such as in leaving footprints on the sands of time which leave no mark of dishonor, but such as really and truly do give new heart and new hope and new courage to the weaker brother.
