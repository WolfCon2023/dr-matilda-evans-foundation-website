The whites of the South by a large and increasing majority make no pretense at the determination of that race to keep the Negro down politically, at least; they depend upon their ability to do this as the only means of continuing themselves in power. When the Negro demands a share in the affairs of the government as he inevitably will and most assuredly should do, then will come concrete examples which will not only justify the separation of the two peoples through some plan of segregation (separation) but make their segregation (separation) imperative.

The climax of the antagonism, which may be dissipated by separating the two peoples, will be reached when the Negro shall not only demand but force the constituted authorities to grant absolute equality in the administration of justice; when he shall not only demand the right to vote, to sit on juries and represent his country in its legislative deliberations and actions but shall force his rights in these premises.

The determination of the white people now is to dominate predominately, and in all human probability this determination is to become intensely more fixed, even at the cost of their very lives, their fortunes and their honor; while the Negros will be equally determined, after equal fitness with the white man for the performance of the duties of citizenship, so determined that no power on earth or Heaven except extermination shall deny them certain inalienable rights which all instruction teaches them, are cheap at any sacrifice. They will never assimilate Patrick Henry’s great speech until they are ready to act it. They can never act it until they are ready to accept death rather than slavery. Without the patriotism and love of liberty inspiring this immortal Virginian they can never develop the ideal that is in them.
