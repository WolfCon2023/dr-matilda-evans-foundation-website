**CHEMISTRY OF THE LIVING ATOM FOR HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE STUDENTS**

**Many people will agree that not many things are as intriguing as the anatomy of the wonderful world of atoms. As human beings we all are made up of millions and millions of atoms. Each biological atom is placed perfectly where it belongs in our body with its own individualistic property, yet each one works in unity, in sync, with the total atomic population of our bodies, just like the planets, stars, meteorites and other heavenly bodies do.  Each atom is a micro solar system, just like the magnificent solar system which is governed by our sun.** **Each atom lives in its own little space. The nucleus is located in the center of this space. The nucleus houses the atom’s protons and neutrons. All around the nucleus is empty space. Actually, the nucleus sits in this area of empty space just like our sun sits in its own empty space. Located within this empty space are tiny particles called electrons. Electrons orbit around the nucleus at a terrific speed just like the planets rotate around our sun.** **What makes atoms a living entity (just like the solar system in which we live) is the “mysterious dance” between the atom’s protons, located in the nucleus and the spinning electrons located in the atom’s space. The protons emit electricity from the nucleus which is a positive charge. The electrons emit magnetism, a negative charge generated from their energy of spinning around the atom at a terrific speed. The attractive tension between the positive electricity from the nucleus and the negative magnetic energy from the electrons sustains the very balance of nature,**    **Some call the harmony of these two energies a “mysterious dance” because their interaction stimulates the atom, causing it to seemingly “dance”. These two waves, one positive and the other negative, connecting back and forth with each other create an unseen force known as Electro-Magnetic energy, or Quantum Wave Energy. The Quantum Wave Energy they produce is not seen but can be measured.   The produced Quantum Wave of Energy provides a force that stimulates the physical properties of both the nucleus and the electrons, causing them to ignite with color, harmony and expression in their “dance”.  Such divine knowledge beckons us to understand the fact that God/Allah/the Creator is seen, yet unseen and that we must do all we can to sustain a balanced state of health, in mind, body and spirit. It beckons us to be mindful of the intelligence of the Creator and to always seek a proper balance, in our own thinking, our prayers and our diets, so we too can remain upright and steadfast by definition of the Creator’s universal order.  Psalm 63: _“I am energized every time I enter your heavenly sanctuary to seek more of your power and drink in more of your glory Oh Lord!”_. MORE NEXT TIME.**
