![](/images/Anusha-288x300.jpg)Anusha Ghosh is a medical student at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine - Columbia. She is motivated to improve the healthcare system, particularly for patients from underrepresented and stigmatized communities. After taking her first medical history class, Anusha became inspired to use local public history as a multi-faceted tool for both historical and cultural preservation and ​guidance for modern public health initiatives. Her undergraduate thesis focused on the legacies of Black healthcare workers in Columbia, who improved health and well-being during the Civil Rights Movement. Specifically, she focused on the work of the honorable Dr. Matilda Evans and the Good Samaritan-Waverly Hospital staff.
