Greetings,

The Dr. Matilda A. Evans Educational Foundation LLC will be presenting seminars, panel discussions, and projects, each one designed to contribute towards a more knowledgeable and healthier world.

Future presentations will include topics such as breast cancer coaching, dealing with prostate cancer, understanding the systems of your body, preventing and coping with diabetes, managing blood pressure, proper nutrition, spiritual wellness.

We will also present lectures on a wide array of science topics, discussions on science current events and history. Other upcoming programs will include community forums on conflict resolution, as well as preventing gun violence in our schools and communities so that we are not only healthy as individuals, but we can live in a mentally and spiritually safe environment.

In the near future we will be accepting applications for scholarships and funding.

Thank you,

The Executive Board of Directors,

The Dr. Matilda A. Evans
