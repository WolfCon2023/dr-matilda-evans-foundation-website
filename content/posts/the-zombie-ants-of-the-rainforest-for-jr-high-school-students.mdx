Have you ever heard of a fungus that attacks ants that crawl on the floor of rain forests in tropical climates? This fungus is commonly known as the “Zombie Ant” fungus. The scientific name is **_Cordyceps_**. It is a fungus that grows on the limbs of trees in tropical forests. In order to live, grow and continue their life cycle, they fall off the tree limbs all the way down to the ground. And then they wait. Silently and very still, they wait for their favorite insect, the busy ant, to come crawling by. The ant unknowingly steps on the waiting fungus and thus contact is made. The fungus then penetrates into the ant’s body and begins to grow inside their host. The first place they overtake is the insect’s brain. This causes the insect to become, “Zombified”. From that point on, the fungus dictates every single move the ant makes. The ant no longer belongs to itself. Its brain now belongs to the fungus that invaded it. The Fungus forces its victim to crawl all the way back up the tree to the very limb it fell from. By the time the unwilling ant carries its host back to the tree limb, its insides have been literally dissolved and eaten away by its invader. The dead and decayed lifeless body of the once busy ant then falls back to the ground. The fungus gets to live yet another life cycle after nurturing from the inside of the ant. The life cycle for this particular type of fungus takes about four to ten days. The cycle of all fungi, (plural for fungus) continues in repeated cycles, over and over again. They don’t die, they just go on repeating their life cycles. Cordyceps are usually located in rainforests in Brazil, Australia, and Thailand. However, in some rare cases they have been found in Florida and South Carolina. NOTE:  please visit _“This Zombie Fungus Mind Controls Insects”_ by Crazy Creatures on YouTube to learn more.
