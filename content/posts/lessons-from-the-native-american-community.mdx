My grandmother, Dr. Matilda A. Evans, was very open-minded. Her study of the mental and behavioral issues in our community was diverse. She even purchased land to create a park in northeast Columbia, SC, where minorities could enjoy nature, well-being, and explore mental and spiritual health as a means of developing a wholesome community.

In 1997, I had the honor of interviewing Wauneta Lone Wolf (April 18, 1951 – December 21, 2003), a nationally recognized Oglala Lakota speaker, social activist, and youth counselor. She is best known for her work in reducing gun violence and gang culture, among other things.

In this interview, Lone Wolf shared valuable insights regarding the core principles of the Native American communities in North America. She explains in depth the Native American community’s ideology which forms the foundation and construct of mental and spiritual health—advice that remains relevant today.

Unfortunately, there is some background noise due to the older recording technology. Please accept our apologies. However, we do encourage you to reflect thoughtfully on her words.
