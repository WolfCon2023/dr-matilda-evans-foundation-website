**THE DR. MATILDA A. EVANS’ CLASS**

Recently, the 19 monks who belong to the **Sangha** Buddhist monastic order walked through our community on their journey, **A Walk for Peace**. They walk in order to accentuate the power of **mindfulness**, and to illustrate the value of practicing **inner peace** in everyday life.

Unfortunately, there were some who misunderstood their purpose. Some may have thought they were representing a religion. For over two thousand years, the monks have never taught a religion. Instead, they practice the example of a man named **Buddha**. They do not worship Buddha; they practice a way of life that was best practiced by him. A monk who is probably best known in modern times is the **Dalai (pronounced “Dolly”) Lama**.

Similarly, spiritual Christians and spiritual Muslims also practice their spirituality in the same way—striving to achieve peace in a complex world through compassion, love, kindness, peaceful dialogue, and universal understanding: a state of being that comes from within.

## Mindfulness, emotions, and self-control

The monks devote themselves to training the mind to be still and stable. They devote their lives to learning how to express more from the thoughtfulness of the heart. This practice does not exclude sadness or anger, nor does it deny emotions. Instead, this training teaches one not to be consumed by emotions.

Their discipline is built through repetition of proper breathing techniques in order to explore balance between the rational thoughts of the mind and the intuition of the heart. The reward is not only inner peace, but also inner wisdom.

## Building healthier communities

When one considers the spirituality of life—not just the religion one practices—we become more capable of bridging beyond the chains and fetters that bind us to the confusion and complexity of adversity. When we, as individuals, accept diversity instead of adversity, we come to better terms with ourselves, our families, our neighborhoods, and the world beyond.

We learn to respect the wisdom and knowledge each person brings to the table, in order to better the social and spiritual environments we dwell in.

Most importantly, all of this lends itself to improving mental health and behavioral health as well. It helps us better understand and manage stress and emotion, become more open-minded and less intensely reactive, and develop practices that go beyond just the personal self—becoming more considerate and respectful of life itself.

We can also begin to accomplish positive social connections and bring down the high rate of crimes such as domestic and verbal violence, child abuse, bullying, theft, and murder in our neighborhoods. Our environments can begin to thrive in wholesome mental wellness and stability.

Mindfulness and meditation offer a purposeful approach to reducing issues like youth gun violence. They encourage calm under pressure, self-awareness, and purpose in life; help replace negative emotions with positive ones; foster openness to change; and provide guidance for building safer, stronger communities. These are necessary strategies youth can apply as they navigate the transitional situations of adolescence.

Mindfulness and meditation are worthy of inspection and dialogue. They go a very long way in helping doctors and social workers with behavioral disorders in our homes, schools, and communities. They also go a long way in helping law enforcement officers keep the peace—because a mentally healthy community is surely a more law-abiding community.

## Ancient roots of mindfulness

Finally, let us not forget that written in ancient Egyptian texts—found in the tomb of **Seti I**, Pharaoh of the 19th dynasty over 3,000 years ago—were instructions about how important spiritual enlightenment, emotional balance, and physical health were to this great civilization.

The hieroglyphs found in his tomb spoke of meditation practices, focusing on conscious self-awareness as a way to achieve unity with the divine. Mindfulness was named **Kemetic Meditations** by the Ancient Egyptians—a term that also meant “clear and keen intellect.” This is often translated in connection with **Thoth**, the Ancient Egyptian scientist of wisdom and recording.

It is written in the hieroglyphs that the Ancient Egyptians believed the heart was the center of thought, emotion, and memory. In fact, they focused keenly on maintaining a very intricate balance between the heart and the mind. They also practiced breathing techniques and proper posture to “take in” the divine energy that circulates throughout our universe.

## Closing thoughts

Finally, whether you understand the monks’ **Walk for Peace** or not, our nation should stay open to actions that support healing, mental health, and safer communities.

Otherwise, as author Dennis William Hauck states in his book *The Emerald Tablet: Alchemy for Personal Transformation*:

> “Psychologically, if we do not reject old habits and beliefs when confronted with the possibility of a better way of being, we will end up imprisoned by a tyrannical ego complex which will perpetrate any illusion just to keep control.”

More next time.

We share this universe together—let’s make the best of it.
